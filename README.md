[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) application boilerplate based on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/), [React Transform HMR](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr) for rapid application development.

## Install

- **If you have installation or compilation issues with this project, please see [our debugging guide](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/400)**

First, clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/ashishpatel0720/calc2
```

And then install dependencies with yarn 

```bash
$ cd your-project-name
$ yarn 
```
Or with npm
```bash
$ cd your-project-name
$ npm install

## Run with yarn

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a webpack dev server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```
Or with npm
```bash
$ npm run dev
```


Alternatively, you can run the renderer and main processes separately. This way, you can restart one process without waiting for the other. Run these two commands **simultaneously** in different console tabs:

```bash
$ yarn start-renderer-dev
$ yarn start-main-dev 
```

If you don't need autofocus when your files was changed, then run `dev` with env `WITHOUT_FOCUS=true`:

```bash
$ WITHOUT_FOCUS=true yarn dev
```

## Packaging

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
$ yarn package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

First, refer to [Multi Platform Build](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build) for dependencies.

Then,

```bash
$ yarn package-all
```

To run End-to-End Test

```bash
$ yarn build
$ yarn test-e2e
```

:bulb: You can debug your production build with devtools by simply setting the `DEBUG_PROD` env variable:

```bash
DEBUG_PROD=true yarn package
```
